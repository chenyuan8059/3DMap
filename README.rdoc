== Idea: 
As part of the hackathon project @Realtor.com company, our idea was to develop a project which helps in comparing nearby areas using 3D technology (Threejs).

== How to run ?
Just clone the repo and run the command <code> rails s </code> (Maybe it will ask to to <code> bundle install </code> before it.)

== URL to run
Use http://localhost:3000/explore?area=santa_clara&type=hot_area.
